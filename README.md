**zAntiAutoClick** is a plugin designed to analyze players' click sessions on entities. At the end of each session, the plugin automatically determines whether the player's behavior appears valid or suspicious.
Its main purpose is to provide detailed insights into player activity, helping you detect potential use of auto-clicking tools.

**Note**: zAntiAutoClick does not apply any automatic punishments. It is up to you to review the data and take appropriate action if cheating is detected.
